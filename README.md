In 2912, The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

From this unique case, we have the objective to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. We use many classification algorithms for this binary classification case. From what I worked on, the results stated that the Catboost Classifier makes the best classifier algorithm with 0.80734 accuracy on the test set followed by Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Logistic Regression.

### Assistant Project Manager - Renewable Energy Research (Tidal Turbine)

Ocean current energy is a promising and reliable resource that offers sustainability and predictability in realizing green future needs. A diffuser-augmented horizontal-axis turbine is utilized to generate ocean current energy. A numerical study on the impact of diffuser angle variations on the power coefficient has been carried out in the previous research. To elucidate the fluid dynamics aspects and further validation of previous computational results, the experimental investigation on the optimal design of tidal turbine with 20.04° diffuser augmentation is presented in this study. The study was conducted in a flowing tank with a current velocity of 0.7 m/s. The maximum power coefficient of 20.04° is 0.436 experimentally, which is a little smaller than the numerical value. Moreover, to reinforce the 20.04° result, a diffuser with an angle of 10.43° was also manufactured and tested experimentally. The maximum power coefficient of 10.43° is 0.303 experimentally, which is 3% smaller than the numerical value. It was concluded that the numerical approach might be considered satisfactory and represent similar phenomena to the experimental investigation in an application for modelling of multi-objective optimization
