When buying a house, customers usually have considerations about things like the presence of a garage, the number of bedrooms, the number of floors, and the age of the house. On this occasion, I am given The Ames Housing dataset compiled by Dean De Cock and provided by Kaggle. This dataset talks about many variables of houses from the count into its variable area. Our objective is to predict the sales price for each house.

I use many regression algorithms to build the model for this case. From what I worked on, the results stated that The CatBoost Regression makes the best prediction with score 0.12635 (TOP 13%) followed by Lightgbm Regression with 0.13600, XGBoost Regression with 0.13846, Random Forest Regression with 0.14769, Ridge Regression with 0.16393, Lasso Regression with 0.18259, Linear Regression with 0.19824. Improvement still can be make by adding by applying cross-validation (CV), and more deeper EDA.

In 2912, The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

From this unique case, we have the objective to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. We use many classification algorithms for this binary classification case. From what I worked on, the results stated that the Catboost Classifier makes the best classifier algorithm with 0.80734 accuracy on the test set followed by Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Logistic Regression.
